Therefore, we decided to make this dashboard light-weight and customizable and maximize interactivity. Therefore, we intially decided to forgo a backend and use d3.js only.

That's why we added Vue.js for state management and for reactively updating the visualizations created by d3. In retrospect, Vuex would have been a great addition to provide even better state management, but a simple SPA like this, it's a better idea to focus on the visualizations rather than state management.
